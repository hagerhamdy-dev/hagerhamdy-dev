I'm a GIS Developer with a growing interest in front-end development.  
I enjoy working with maps, data, and anything we can build with code to create a real impact on society. I'm also passionate about problem solving and connecting ideas across different fields.

I come from an engineering and geomatics background, and have worked with:
- Point cloud processing  
- 3D visualization using Potree  
- Spatial SQL analytics  
- Interactive geospatial applications

### 🚧 Right now, I'm focused on learning:
- Front-end development technologies  
- Advanced React  
- Web mapping libraries: Leaflet, OpenLayers, Mapbox  
- Spatial platforms: Esri JavaScript API, GeoServer  
- 3D data visualization with Potree and WebGL  
- Advanced spatial queries using PostgreSQL/PostGIS via pgAdmin  

---

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Small front-end projects to practice React and map integration
- Exploring how to combine geospatial data with modern web technologies

### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source GIS or front-end projects
- Interactive mapping tools and spatial data visualizations
- Any project where I can learn and contribute to building something meaningful

🌱 I'm always learning, experimenting, and trying to build things that are both useful and meaningful.
